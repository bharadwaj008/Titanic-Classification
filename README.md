# Titanic-Classification
 I have chosen to employ the Titanic survival dataset, which is a pervasive resource in the field of machine learning for classification tasks and built several classification models on this dataset and did feature engineering and EDA to find the patterns among the features and add new features and remmoved trivial features and performed the data manipulation based on the results from EDA. I have leveraged LogisticRegression, Random Forest classifier, SVM Classifier, KNN Classifier, SGD Classifier, Perceptron and got the highest acuarcy of **92.7** for random forest classifier without any hyperparameter tuning.
